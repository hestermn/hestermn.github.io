                        The challenge of this project was to select an object to redesign using key principles in human factors psychology. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, motorcycles account for 15% of all traffic fatalities and 18% of all occupant
                        fatalities despite the fact that motorcycles only account for .7% of all vehicle miles travelled (2014).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Though automobiles are one of the best examples of adjustability, motorcycles have very few adjustable features, controls that can lead to fatigue, and displays that are often out of the riderâ€™s field of view.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Due to these issues, I worked with a team to prototype a more adjustable motorcycle. The goals of this project was to provide improved safety, account for different populations and therefore improving the fit to the rider, and redesigning displays and
                        controls for better usability.

                <div id="motosubdiv">
                    After creating a prototype of an adjustable motorcycle and displays, we tested the prototype with the 5th percentile female and the 95th percentile male. The motorcycle prototype accommodated a wider population than current motorcycle models. The displays
                    and controls were also easier to control and view.
