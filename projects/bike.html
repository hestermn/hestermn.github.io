                        The design goal for this project was to create a bicycle navigational display for riders that did not remove their attention from the road. Current technology for navigation on bicycles makes use of the riderâ€™s visual or auditory attention. This often
                        creates unsafe situations as the environment of a road can change rapidly.

                        The visual feedback given by the LEDs are red and green on both the right and left side of the handlebars. This is an ambient display so that riders can see the direction that they need to turn without looking down at the display. The haptic feedback
                        serves as a secondary alert in case the rider does not see the lights. The motors vibrate on both sides of the handlebars.

                    The strengths of the current prototype are that it meets many of the requirements set during the initial design process. It is capable of alerting bicyclist of different turns without removing their attention from the road. Along with this, users found
                    the devices easy to learn and use, and believed that the alerts would be recognizable in many different situations a rider may encounter on the road.
